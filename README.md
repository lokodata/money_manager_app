# **Money Manager App**

Welcome to your money manager. Where nothing is personal. Your money is **OUR** money. (this is a joke haha)

## Problems for fixing

Problem if the total balance, total income, and total expenses goes more than many values for all the widget that needs this value

(DONE) Add feature of showing not just expenses in chart but also income. 2 lines should be in the chart

Make chart filter to yearly - monthly - daily

Put all transactions data to different page

Colors:
Primary - 7a6df6
Secondary - 6df6b9
Tertiary - 916df6
Neutral - f6f6f6
